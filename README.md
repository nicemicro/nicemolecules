# Nice Molecules

**Nice Molecules** is a free software molecular formula drawing tool in early development. The project
aims to provide a framework to work with covalently bondend molecules, which follows the laws of
chemistry.

# Project goals

This project aims to conatain:
  * a library of chemical elements and their properties that can be used independently of the program,
  * a library that handles the chemical behavior of elements, bonds between elements and molecules, that
can be used independently of the program,
  * and a GUI application that takes advantage of the libraries and gives the user an easy-to use method
for drawing chemically sound molecules, and gives information on the molecules drawn.

# Help wanted

  * I'm not good at UI and UX design. Any help with those aspects are greatly appreciated.
  * Bug testers are welcome.
  * I haven't learned general chemistry in English (which is not my native tongue), so I need help with
the terminology used in the source code and the interface.
